# Neumonia_Neural_Network

This repository is made using EfficinetNetB4 neural network algorithm for advanced CNN. 

This was applied to Pneumonia dataset which in return gave positive result with AUC being 94%, and more.

This repository contains code for preprocessing, EfficinetNetB4 implement, and saving the model.
